🥦 Turning Data into Profit: Financial Strategies for Thriving in the Vegetable Business
This project is a comprehensive data analysis case study conducted as part of the BDM Capstone at the IIT Madras BS Degree Program. The study revolves around "Vishnu Kumar and Sons", a small yet ambitious vegetable vendor based in Kanpur. The primary objective: boost profitability and minimize inventory wastage through smart, data-driven strategies.

📌 Problem Statement
The vendor faced two major challenges:

❌ High inventory wastage from overstocking perishable vegetables

📉 Stagnant profit growth despite steady sales figures

📊 Methodology
To tackle these issues, we:

• Collected historical sales and inventory data from Khata-books and direct owner interviews

• Digitized, cleaned, and structured the data using Excel and Google Sheets

• Performed Descriptive Statistics, Trend Analysis, and ABC Classification

• Created insightful visualizations (bar charts, line graphs, pie charts) to guide decision-making

🔍 Key Insights
🥇 Top-performing vegetables: Tomatoes, potatoes, onions, coriander

🚫 Low-demand, high-waste items: Bottle gourd, ridge gourd, green chillies

📆 Peak sales on Mondays and Sundays; mid-week dips present promo opportunities

✅ ABC Analysis helped prioritize stock based on demand and profitability

💡 Recommendations
To improve efficiency and margins:

📦 Optimize inventory by reducing stock of slow-moving vegetables

🛒 Launch combo offers, seasonal promotions, and pre-cut vegetable packs

💸 Introduce mid-week discounts and mobile cart deliveries for outreach

📲 Embrace digital tools like UPI payments and WhatsApp orders for operational ease

📈 Projected Impact
Implementing these strategies is expected to:

♻️ Reduce wastage significantly

💰 Increase profit margins sustainably

😊 Improve customer satisfaction and expand market presence

This case study demonstrates the power of data in transforming even the smallest of businesses. Smart decisions start with smart insights.
